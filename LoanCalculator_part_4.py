# Finally, let's add to our calculator the capacity to compute differentiated payments. Weâ€™ll 
# do this for the type of repayment where the loan principal is reduced by a constant amount 
# each month. The rest of the monthly payment goes toward interest repayment and it is gradually 
# reduced over the term of the loan. This means that the payment is different each month. Letâ€™s 
# look at the formula:

# Dm = P / n + i * (P - P * (m - 1) / n)

# Where:
# Dm = mth differentiated payment
# P = loan principal
# i = nominal (monthly) interest rate. Usually, it is 1/12 of the annual interest rate and 
#     is a floating value, not a percentage. For example, if your annual interest rate = 12%, then i = 0.01
# n = number of payments. This is usually the number of months in which repayments will be made.
# m = current repayment month.

 ### Objective ###
 # In this stage, you are going to implement the following features:

# 1) Calculation of differentiated payments. To do this, the user can run the program specifying interest, 
#    number of monthly payments, and loan principal.
# 2) Ability to calculate the same values as in the previous stage for annuity payment (principal, number 
#    of monthly payments, and monthly payment amount). The user specifies all the known parameters with command-line 
#    arguments, and one parameter will be unknown. This is the value the user wants to calculate.

### Output ###
# NOTE: The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that this is not part of the input.

# Example 1: calculating differentiated payments

# type=diff principal=1000000 periods=10 interest=10

# Month 1: payment is 108334
# Month 2: payment is 107500
# Month 3: payment is 106667
# Month 4: payment is 105834
# Month 5: payment is 105000
# Month 6: payment is 104167
# Month 7: payment is 103334
# Month 8: payment is 102500
# Month 9: payment is 101667
# Month 10: payment is 100834

# Overpayment = 45837

# Example 2: calculate the annuity payment for a 60-month (5-year) loan with a principal amount of 1,000,000 at 10% interest

# type=annuity principal=1000000 periods=60 interest=10

# Your annuity payment = 21248!
# Overpayment = 274880

# Example 3: calculate differentiated payments given a principal of 500,000 over 8 months at an interest rate of 7.8%

# type=diff principal=500000 periods=8 interest=7.8

# Month 1: payment is 65750
# Month 2: payment is 65344
# Month 3: payment is 64938
# Month 4: payment is 64532
# Month 5: payment is 64125
# Month 6: payment is 63719
# Month 7: payment is 63313
# Month 8: payment is 62907

# Overpayment = 14628

# Example 4: calculate the principal for a user paying 8,722 per month for 120 months (10 years) at 5.6% interest

# type=annuity payment=8722 periods=120 interest=5.6

# Your loan principal = 800018!
# Overpayment = 246622

# Example 5: calculate how long it will take to repay a loan with 500,000 principal, monthly payment of 23,000, and 7.8% interest

# type=annuity principal=500000 payment=23000 interest=7.8

# It will take 2 years to repay this loan!
# Overpayment = 52000
